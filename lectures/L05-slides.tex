  \frametitle{Passing Data to Pthreads threads\ldots Wrongly}


Consider this snippet:
\vfill
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
  pthread_create(&thread[i], NULL, run, (void*)&i);
\end{lstlisting}
  \vfill
  This is a \alert{terrible} idea. Why?
  \vfill
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item<2-> The value of {\tt i} will probably change before the thread executes
    \item<2-> The memory for {\tt i} may be out of scope, and therefore invalid by
          the time the thread executes
  \end{enumerate}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Passing Data to Pthreads threads}
  
Correct:


\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int i;
int*
for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
  arg = malloc( sizeof( int ) );
  *arg = i;
  pthread_create(&thread[i], NULL, run, arg);
}
\end{lstlisting}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{\texttt{int*} and \texttt{int} are always the same size, right guys?}

What about:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
  pthread_create(&thread[i], NULL, run, (void*)i);

...

void* run(void* arg) {
  int id = (int)arg;
\end{lstlisting}
  \vfill
  This is suggested in the book, but should carry a warning:

  \vfill
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<2-> Beware size mismatches between arguments: 
      no guarantee that a pointer is the same size as an int, so your data
      may overflow.
    \item<2-> Sizes of data types change between systems. For maximum
      portability, just use pointers you got {\tt from malloc}.
  \end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Passing Data to C++11 threads}

It's easier to get data to threads in C++11:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>

void run(int i) {
  std::cout << "In run " << i << "\n";
}

int main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    std::thread t1(run, i);
    t1.detach(); // see the next slide...
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Getting Data from C++11 threads}

    \ldots but it's harder to get data back.\\
    Use {\tt async} and {\tt future} abstractions:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>
#include <future>

int run() {
  return 42;
}

int main() {
  std::future<int> t1_retval =
                  std::async(std::launch::async, run);
  std::cout << t1_retval.get();
}
\end{lstlisting}

  
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Detached Threads}


  {\it Joinable} threads (the default) wait for someone to call
  {\tt pthread\_join} before they release their resources.
  \vfill
  {\it Detached} threads release their resources when they terminate, without
  being joined.
  \vfill
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);
  \end{lstlisting}
  \vfill
  {\bf thread}: marks the thread as detached
  \vfill
  returns 0 on success, error number otherwise.
  \vfill
  Calling {\tt pthread\_detach} on an already detached thread results in undefined
  behaviour.


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Thread Termination}


  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
void pthread_exit(void *retval);
  \end{lstlisting}
  \vfill
  {\bf retval}: return value passed to function that calls {\tt pthread\_join}
  \vfill
  start\_routine returning is equivalent to calling {\tt pthread\_exit} with
  that return value;
  \vfill
  {\tt pthread\_exit} is called implicitly when the {\tt start\_routine} of a
  thread returns.
  \vfill
  There is no C++11 equivalent.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Attributes}


  By default, threads are {\it joinable} on Linux, but a more portable way to
  know what you're getting is to set thread attributes. You can change:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Detached or joinable state
    \item Scheduling inheritance
    \item Scheduling policy
    \item Scheduling parameters
    \item Scheduling contention scope
    \item Stack size
    \item Stack address
    \item Stack guard (overflow) size
  \end{itemize}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Attributes---Example}


  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
size_t stacksize;
pthread_attr_t attributes;
pthread_attr_init(&attributes);
pthread_attr_getstacksize(&attributes, &stacksize);
printf("Stack size = %i\n", stacksize);
pthread_attr_destroy(&attributes);
  \end{lstlisting}
Running this on a laptop produces:
  \begin{lstlisting}
jon@riker examples master % ./stack_size 
Stack size = 8388608
  \end{lstlisting}
  Setting a thread state to joinable:
  \begin{lstlisting}
pthread_attr_setdetachstate(&attributes,
                            PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE);
  \end{lstlisting}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Detached Threads: Warning!}


\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void* run(void*) {
  printf("In run\n");
}

int main() {
  pthread_t thread;
  pthread_create(&thread, NULL, run, NULL);
  pthread_detach(thread);
  printf("In main\n");
}
\end{lstlisting}

  When I run it, it just prints ``In main'', why?


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Detached Threads: Solution to Problem}

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void* run(void*) {
  printf("In run\n");
}

int main() {
  pthread_t thread;
  pthread_create(&thread, NULL, run, NULL);
  pthread_detach(thread);
  printf("In main\n");
  pthread_exit(NULL); // This waits for all detached
                      // threads to terminate
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  Make the final call {\tt pthread\_exit} if you have any detached threads. (There is no C++11 equivalent.)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Threading Challenges}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Be aware of scheduling (you can also set affinity with pthreads on
      Linux).
    \vfill
    \item Make sure the libraries you use are {\bf thread-safe}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Means that the library protects its shared data.
      \end{itemize}
    \vfill
    \item glibc reentrant functions are also safe: a program can have more than one
      thread calling these functions concurrently.
    \vfill
    \item {\bf Example:} {\tt rand\_r} versus
      {\tt rand}.
  \end{itemize}
