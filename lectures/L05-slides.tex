\begin{frame}
\frametitle{UNIX Workflow}

Parent spawns the child process with the \texttt{fork} system call. 

If waiting for the child process to finish, \texttt{wait}.\\
\quad Alternatively, carry on.

When the child process is finished, it returns a value with \texttt{exit} 

The parent gets this as the return value of \texttt{wait} and may proceed.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{About \texttt{fork}}

Note: \texttt{fork} creates a new process as a copy of itself.

Both parent and child continue after that statement.

The call \texttt{fork} can return a value:\\
\quad A negative value means the fork failed.\\
\quad A zero value means this process is the child.\\
\quad A positive value: this is the parent; the value is the child \texttt{pid}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{After the \texttt{fork}, the \texttt{exec}}


After the \texttt{fork}, one of the processes may use the \texttt{exec} system call.

This will replace its memory space with a new program. 

There's no rule that says this must happen\\
\quad a child can continue to be a clone of its parent if it wishes.

The \texttt{exec} invocation loads a binary file into memory \& starts execution. 

At this point, the programs can go their separate ways.

Or the parent might want to wait for the child to finish.

\frametitle{Putting it Together}

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
int main()
{
  pid_t pid;
  int childStatus;

  /* fork a child process */
  pid = fork();
  
  if (pid < 0) { 
  
    /* error occurred */ 
    fprintf(stderr, "Fork Failed"); 
    return 1;
    
 } else if (pid == 0) { 
    /* child process */
    execlp("/bin/ls","ls",NULL);
    
  } else { 
    /* parent process */
    /* parent will wait for the child to complete */
    wait(&childStatus);
    printf("Child Complete with status: %i \n", childStatus);

\frametitle{Code Output}

Thus, the output is:

jz@Freyja:~/fork$ ./fork 
fork   fork.c
Child Complete with status: 0
jz@Freyja:~/fork$ 
\end{verbatim}

  \frametitle{Assumptions}


  First, we'll see how to use threads on ``embarrassingly parallel problems''.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item mostly-independent sub-problems (little synchronization); and
    \item strong locality (little communication).
  \end{itemize}
  \vfill
  Later, we'll see:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item which problems can be parallelized (\structure{dependencies})
    \item alternative parallelization patterns\\(right now, just use one thread
          per sub-problem)
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{POSIX Threads}


  \begin{itemize}
    \item Available on most systems
    \vfill
    \item Windows has Pthreads Win32, but I wouldn't use it; \\use Linux for
          this course
    \vfill
    \item API available by {\tt \#include <pthread.h>}
    \vfill
    \item Compile with pthread flag \\ ({\tt gcc -pthread prog.c -o prog})
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{C++ 11 Threads}


  \begin{itemize}
    \item Now part of the C++ standard (library)
    \vfill
    \item API available with {\tt \#include <thread>}
    \vfill
    \item Compile with flags: \\ (\verb!g++ -std=c++11 -pthread prog.c -o prog!)

  {\bf thread}: creates a handle to a thread at pointer location

  \vfill
  {\bf thread}: wait for this thread to terminate (thread must be~joinable).

  {\bf retval}: stores exit status of thread (set by {\tt pthread\_exit}) to
                 the location pointed by *retval. If cancelled, returns
                 {\tt PTHREAD\_CANCELED}. {\tt NULL} is ignored.

  {\bf Only call this one time per thread!} Multiple calls on the same thread

  \frametitle{Passing Data to Pthreads threads\ldots Wrongly}


Consider this snippet:
\vfill
\begin{lstlisting}
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
  pthread_create(&thread[i], NULL, &run, (void*)&i);
\end{lstlisting}
  \vfill
  This is a \alert{terrible} idea. Why?
  \vfill
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item<2-> The value of {\tt i} will probably change before the thread executes
    \item<2-> The memory for {\tt i} may be out of scope, and therefore invalid by
          the time the thread executes
  \end{enumerate}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Passing Data to Pthreads threads}


What about:
\begin{lstlisting}
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
  pthread_create(&thread[i], NULL, &run, (void*)i);

...

void* run(void* arg) {
  int id = (int)arg;
\end{lstlisting}
  \vfill
  This is suggested in the book, but should carry a warning:

  \vfill
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<2-> Beware size mismatches between arguments: 
      no guarantee that a pointer is the same size as an int, so your data
      may overflow.
    \item<2-> Sizes of data types change between systems. For maximum
      portability, just use pointers you got {\tt from malloc}.
  \end{itemize}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Passing Data to C++11 threads}

It's easier to get data to threads in C++11:
\begin{lstlisting}
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>

void run(int i) {
  std::cout << "In run " << i << "\n";
}

int main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    std::thread t1(run, i);
    t1.detach(); // see the next slide...
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Getting Data from C++11 threads}

    \ldots but it's harder to get data back.\\
    Use {\tt async} and {\tt future} abstractions:
    \begin{lstlisting}
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>
#include <future>

int run() {
  return 42;
}

int main() {
  std::future<int> t1_retval =
                  std::async(std::launch::async, run);
  std::cout << t1_retval.get();
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Detached Threads}


  {\it Joinable} threads (the default) wait for someone to call
  {\tt pthread\_join} before they release their resources.
  \vfill
  {\it Detached} threads release their resources when they terminate, without
  being joined.
  \vfill
  \begin{lstlisting}
int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);
  \end{lstlisting}
  \vfill
  {\bf thread}: marks the thread as detached
  \vfill
  returns 0 on success, error number otherwise.
  \vfill
  Calling {\tt pthread\_detach} on an already detached thread results in undefined
  behaviour.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Thread Termination}


  \begin{lstlisting}
void pthread_exit(void *retval);
  \end{lstlisting}
  \vfill
  {\bf retval}: return value passed to function that calls {\tt pthread\_join}
  \vfill
  start\_routine returning is equivalent to calling {\tt pthread\_exit} with
  that return value;
  \vfill
  {\tt pthread\_exit} is called implicitly when the {\tt start\_routine} of a
  thread returns.
  \vfill
  There is no C++11 equivalent.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Attributes}


  By default, threads are {\it joinable} on Linux, but a more portable way to
  know what you're getting is to set thread attributes. You can change:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Detached or joinable state
    \item Scheduling inheritance
    \item Scheduling policy
    \item Scheduling parameters
    \item Scheduling contention scope
    \item Stack size
    \item Stack address
    \item Stack guard (overflow) size
  \end{itemize}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Attributes---Example}


  \begin{lstlisting}
size_t stacksize;
pthread_attr_t attributes;
pthread_attr_init(&attributes);
pthread_attr_getstacksize(&attributes, &stacksize);
printf("Stack size = %i\n", stacksize);
pthread_attr_destroy(&attributes);
  \end{lstlisting}
Running this on a laptop produces:
  \begin{lstlisting}
jon@riker examples master % ./stack_size 
Stack size = 8388608
  \end{lstlisting}
  Setting a thread state to joinable:
  \begin{lstlisting}
pthread_attr_setdetachstate(&attributes,
                            PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE);
  \end{lstlisting}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Detached Threads: Warning!}


\begin{lstlisting}
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void* run(void*) {
  printf("In run\n");
}

int main() {
  pthread_t thread;
  pthread_create(&thread, NULL, &run, NULL);
  pthread_detach(thread);
  printf("In main\n");
}
\end{lstlisting}

  When I run it, it just prints ``In main'', why?


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Detached Threads: Solution to Problem}

  \begin{lstlisting}
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void* run(void*) {
  printf("In run\n");
}

int main() {
  pthread_t thread;
  pthread_create(&thread, NULL, &run, NULL);
  pthread_detach(thread);
  printf("In main\n");
  pthread_exit(NULL); // This waits for all detached
                      // threads to terminate
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  Make the final call {\tt pthread\_exit} if you have any detached threads. (There is no C++11 equivalent.)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Threading Challenges}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Be aware of scheduling (you can also set affinity with pthreads on
      Linux).
    \vfill
    \item Make sure the libraries you use are {\bf thread-safe}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Means that the library protects its shared data.
      \end{itemize}
    \vfill
    \item glibc reentrant functions are also safe: a program can have more than one
      thread calling these functions concurrently.
    \vfill
    \item {\bf Example:} {\tt rand\_r} versus
      {\tt rand}.
