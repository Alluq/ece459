\frametitle{Locks and Atomics}

 Atomics are a lower-overhead alternative to
locks as long as you're doing suitable operations. 

Remember that what we wanted sometimes with locks and mutexes and all that is that operations are indivisible.

Ex: an update to a variable doesn't get interfered with by another update. 

Remember the key idea is: an \alert{atomic operation} is indivisible.\\
\quad Other threads see state before or after the operation; nothing in between.

\frametitle{Yet Another Rant About C++}

Although I guess in C++ you could define one if you wanted. 

This is kind of a dangerous thing about C++. 

If in C you see a line of code like \texttt{z = x + y;} you can have a pretty good idea about what it does and you can infer that there's some sort of natural meaning to the + operator there, like addition or concatenation. 

In C++, however, this same line of code tells you nothing unless you know...\\
\quad (1) the type of \texttt{x},\\
\quad (2) the type of \texttt{y}, and\\
\quad (3) how the \texttt{+} operator is defined on those two operands \textit{in that order}. 

But I'm digressing.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What to do with Atomics}

  
    \Large
    Kinds of operations:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item reads
    \item writes
    \item read-modify-write (RMW)
    \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Reads and Writes}

  
    C++ has syntax to make these all transparent:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
#include <atomic>
#include <iostream>

std::atomic<int> ai;
int i;

int main() {
    ai = 4;
    i = ai;
    ai = i;
    std::cout << i;
}
\end{lstlisting}
Can also use {\tt i = ai.load()} and {\tt ai.store(i)}.
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Read-Modify-Write (RMW)}

  
    Consider {\tt ai++}.\\[1em]
    This is really \\
    ~~~{\tt tmp = ai.read(); tmp++; ai.write(tmp); }\\[1em]
    Hardware can do that atomically.\\[1em]
    Other RMWs: {\tt +-, \&=, etc, compare-and-swap}\\[2em]

  \frametitle{Three Address Code}

  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item An intermediate code used by compilers
      for analysis and optimization.
    \vfill
    \item Statements represent one fundamental operation---we
      can consider each operation \structure{atomic}.
    \vfill
    \item Statements have the form:\\
      $\qquad result := operand_1\:operator\:operand_2$
    \vfill
    \item Useful for reasoning about data races,\\ and easier to read than assembly. \\
            \hspace*{1cm} (separates out memory reads/writes).
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{GIMPLE}

  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item GIMPLE is the three address code used by {\tt gcc}.
    \vfill
    \item To see the GIMPLE representation of your code use the
      {\tt -fdump-tree-gimple} flag.
    \vfill
    \item To see all of the three address code generated by the compiler use
      {\tt -fdump-tree-all}. You'll probably just be interested in the
      optimized version.
    \vfill
    \item Use GIMPLE to reason about your code at a low level without
      having to read assembly.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Branch Prediction Hints}

  
  As seen earlier in class, {\tt gcc} allows you to give branch
  prediction hints by calling this builtin function:

  \begin{center}
    \verb+long __builtin_expect (long exp, long c)+
  \end{center}

  The expected result is that {\tt exp} equals {\tt c}.\\[1em]
  Compiler reorders code \& tells CPU the prediction.

  \frametitle{The {\tt restrict} Keyword}

   
   A new feature of C99: ``The restrict type qualifier allows programs to
      be written so that translators can produce significantly faster
      executables.''
  \begin{itemize}
    \item To request C99 in {\tt gcc}, use the {\tt -std=c99} flag.
  \end{itemize}
~\\
   {\tt restrict} means: you are promising the
      compiler that the pointer will never \structure{alias} (another pointer
      will not point to the same data) for the lifetime of the pointer.
  

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Take the Vow}


I, [insert your name], a PROFESSIONAL or AMATEUR [circle one] programmer recognize that there are limits to what a compiler can do. I certify that, to the best of my knowledge, there are no magic elves or monkeys in the compiler which through the forces of fairy dust can always make code faster. I understand that there are some problems for which there is not enough information to solve. I hereby declare that given the opportunity to provide the compiler with sufficient information, perhaps through some key word, I will gladly use said keyword and not bitch and moan about how "the compiler should be doing this for me."

In this case, I promise that the pointer declared along with the restrict qualifier is not aliased. I certify that writes through this pointer will not effect the values read through any other pointer available in the same context which is also declared as restricted.

* Your agreement to this contract is implied by use of the restrict keyword ;)



\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Example of {\tt restrict} (1)}

  
    Pointers declared with {\tt restrict} must
       never point to the same data.
~\\[1em]
    From Wikipedia:

  \begin{lstlisting}
void updatePtrs(int* ptrA, int* ptrB, int* val) {
    *ptrA += *val;
    *ptrB += *val;
}
  \end{lstlisting}
 Would declaring all these pointers as
      {\tt restrict} generate better code?
  

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Example of {\tt restrict} (2)}

  
    Let's look at the GIMPLE:

  \begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
void updatePtrs(int* ptrA, int* ptrB, int* val) {
 D.1609 = *ptrA;
 D.1610 = *val;
 D.1611 = D.1609 + D.1610;
 *ptrA = D.1611;
 D.1612 = *ptrB;
 D.1610 = *val;
 D.1613 = D.1612 + D.1610;
 *ptrB = D.1613;
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Could any operation be left out if all the pointers
      didn't overlap?
  \end{itemize}  
  

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Example of {\tt restrict} (3)}

  
  \begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
void updatePtrs(int* ptrA, int* ptrB, int* val) {
 D.1609 = *ptrA;
 D.1610 = *val;
 D.1611 = D.1609 + D.1610;
 *ptrA = D.1611;
 D.1612 = *ptrB;
 D.1610 = *val;
 D.1613 = D.1612 + D.1610;
 *ptrB = D.1613;
}
  \end{lstlisting}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If {\tt ptrA} and {\tt val} are not equal, you don't have to
      reload the data on {\bf line 7}.
    \item Otherwise, you would: there might be a call\\{\tt ~~~~updatePtrs(\&x, \&y,
      \&x);}
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Example of {\tt restrict} (4)}
  
  Hence, this markup allows optimization:
  \begin{lstlisting}
void updatePtrs(int* restrict ptrA, 
                int* restrict ptrB,
                int* restrict val)
  \end{lstlisting}
  Note: you can get the optimization by just declaring {\tt ptrA} and
      {\tt val} as {\tt restrict}; {\tt ptrB} isn't needed for this optimization
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Summary of {\tt restrict}}

  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use {\tt restrict} whenever you know the pointer will not alias
      another pointer (also declared {\tt restrict})
  \end{itemize}

    It's hard for the compiler to infer pointer aliasing information;
    it's easier for you to specify it.\\[1em]

    $\Rightarrow$ compiler can better optimize your code (more perf!)\\[1em]

    Caveat: don't lie to the compiler, or  you will get
      \alert{undefined behaviour}.\\[1em]

    Aside: {\tt restrict} is not the same as {\tt const}. {\tt const} data can still be
      changed through an alias.
