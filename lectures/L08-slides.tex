  \frametitle{Why non-blocking I/O?}
  
  Consider some I/O:


\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
    fd = open(...);
    read(...);
    close(fd);
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}


  Not very performant---under what conditions do we lose out?

  \frametitle{Not Quite So Easy}

    Doesn't work on files---they're always ready. Only e.g. sockets.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Other Outstanding Problem with Nonblocking I/O}

    How do you know when I/O is ready to be queried?

    \only<2>{\begin{itemize} 
      \item polling ({\tt select}, {\tt poll}, {\tt epoll})
      \item interrupts (signals)
      \end{itemize}
    }

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Using {\tt epoll}}
  
    Key idea: give {\tt epoll} a bunch of file descriptors;\\
     \hspace*{2em}wait for events to happen.\\[1em]

     Steps:
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item create an instance ({\tt epoll\_create1});
       \item populate it with file descriptors ({\tt epoll\_ctl});
       \item wait for events ({\tt epoll\_wait}).
     \end{enumerate}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Creating an {\tt epoll} instance}
  
    \begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
    \begin{lstlisting}
   int epfd = epoll_create1(0);
    \end{lstlisting}
    \end{minipage}

    {\tt efpd} doesn't represent any files; use it to talk to {\tt epoll}.\\[1em]

    0 represents the flags (only flag: {\tt EPOLL\_CLOEXEC}).
    
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Populating the {\tt epoll} instance}
  
    To add {\tt fd} to the set of descriptors watched by {\tt epfd}:
    \begin{lstlisting}
   struct epoll_event event;
   int ret;
   event.data.fd = fd;
   event.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLOUT;
   ret = epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, fd, &event);
    \end{lstlisting}

    Can also modify and delete descriptors from {\tt epfd}.
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Waiting on an {\tt epoll} instance}
  
    Now we're ready to wait for events on any file descriptor in {\tt epfd}.
    \begin{lstlisting}
  #define MAX_EVENTS 64

  struct epoll_event events[MAX_EVENTS];
  int nr_events;

  nr_events = epoll_wait(epfd, events, MAX_EVENTS, -1);
    \end{lstlisting}

-1: wait potentially forever; otherwise, milliseconds to wait.\\[1em]

Upon return from {\tt epoll\_wait}, we have {\tt nr\_events} events ready.

  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Level-Triggered and Edge-Triggered Events}
  
    Default {\tt epoll} behaviour is \structure{level-triggered}:\\
    \quad return whenever data is ready.\\[1em]

    Can also specify (via {\tt epoll\_ctl}) \structure{edge-triggered} behaviour:\\
    \quad return whenever there is a change in readiness.\\[1em]
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Asynchronous I/O}
  
    POSIX standard defines \structure{aio} calls.\\[1em]

    These work for disk as well as sockets.\\[1em]

    Key idea: you specify the action to occur when I/O is ready:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item nothing;
      \item start a new thread;
      \item raise a signal
    \end{itemize}

    Submit the requests using e.g. {\tt aio\_read} and {\tt aio\_write}.\\[1em]
    Can wait for I/O to happen using {\tt aio\_suspend}.
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Nonblocking I/O with curl}
  
    Similar idea to {\tt epoll}:
\begin{itemize}
\item build up a set of descriptors;
\item invoke the transfers and wait for them to finish;
\item see how things went.
\end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Classic, Blocking cURL Request}

Here's a simple cURL program that we can look over:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <stdio.h>
#include <curl/curl.h>
 
int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
  CURL *curl;
  CURLcode res;
 
  curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT);
 
  curl = curl_easy_init();
  if( curl ) {
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/" );
    res = curl_easy_perform( curl );
    
  if( res != CURLE_OK ) {
      fprintf(stderr, "curl_easy_perform() failed: %s\n", curl_easy_strerror(res));
    }
    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
  }
 
  curl_global_cleanup();
  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}


\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{curl\_multi initialization}

  
    curl\_multi: work with multiple resources at once.\\[1em]
    
    1. To use {\tt curl\_multi}, first create the individual requests \\ \hspace{2em} ({\tt curl\_easy\_init}).\\
    ~~~(Set options as needed on each handle).\\[1em]

    2. Then, combine them with:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item {\tt curl\_multi\_init()};
      \item {\tt curl\_multi\_add\_handle()}.
    \end{itemize}

  

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Open Fire!}

Start reqs: \texttt{curl\_multi\_perform( CURLM* cm, int* still\_running )}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/artillery.jpeg}
\end{center}

The second parameter is updated with the number of still-in-progress requests.

Meantime, we can do other things!

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{I'm bored... So take a nap?}

Suppose we've run out of things to do and nothing is ready yet. Wait!

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
curl_multi_wait( CURLM *multi_handle, struct curl_waitfd extra_fds[], 
unsigned int extra_nfds, int timeout_ms, int *numfds )
\end{lstlisting}

This function will block the current thread until something happens.

Choose how long to wait and see how many events occurred.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{While You Were Sleeping}

While we are asleep or doing other things, callbacks still happen.

The status of the cURL easy handle is updated.

\end{frame}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Knowing what happened after {\tt curl\_multi\_perform}}

  
    {\tt curl\_multi\_info\_read} will tell you.
  
\begin{lstlisting}
  msg = curl_multi_info_read(multi_handle, &msgs_left);
\end{lstlisting}
  
    and also how many messages are left.\\[1em]
    {\tt msg->msg} can be {\tt CURLMSG\_DONE} or an error;\\
    {\tt msg->easy\_handle} tells you who is done.\\[1em]
  

    Some gotchas (thanks Desiye Collier):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Checking \verb+msg->msg == CURLMSG_DONE+ is not sufficient to ensure that a curl request actually happened. You also need to check {\tt data.result}.

    \item (A1 hint:) To reset an individual handle in the {\tt multi\_handle}, you need to ``replace'' it. But you shouldn't use {\tt curl\_easy\_init()}.  In fact, you don't need a new handle at all.
    \end{itemize}
  

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{curl\_multi cleanup}

  
    Call {\tt curl\_multi\_cleanup} on the multi handle.\\[1em]
    Then, call {\tt curl\_easy\_cleanup} on each easy handle.\\[2em]
    If you replace {\tt curl\_easy\_init} by {\tt curl\_global\_init},\\
    then call {\tt curl\_global\_cleanup} also.
  

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Long Example}

The long example is too big for the slides. 

We'll have to take look at it in the notes!

  \frametitle{Process, Threads, AIO?! Four Choices}

  
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Blocking I/O; 1 process per request.
      \item Blocking I/O; 1 thread per request.
      \item Asynchronous I/O, pool of threads, \\callbacks, \\ each thread handles multiple connections.
      \item Nonblocking I/O, pool of threads, \\ multiplexed with select/poll,
        event-driven, \\ each thread handles multiple connections.
    \end{itemize}
  

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Blocking I/O; 1 process per request}

  
  Old Apache model: \hfill \includegraphics[width=.2\textwidth]{images/httpd_logo_wide_new}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Main thread waits for connections.
    \item Upon connect, forks off a new process, \\which completely
      handles the connection.
    \item Each I/O request is blocking: \\ e.g. reads wait until more data arrives.
  \end{itemize}

  Advantage: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item ``Simple to undertand and easy to program.''
  \end{itemize}

  Disadvantage:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item High overhead from starting 1000s of processes.\\
      (can somewhat mitigate with process pool).
  \end{itemize}
  Can handle $\sim$10 000 processes, but doesn't generally scale.

  

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Blocking I/O; 1 thread per request}

  
    We know that threads are more lightweight than processes.\\[1em]

    Same as 1 process per request, but less overhead.\\[1em]

    I/O is the same---still blocking.\\[1em]

    Advantage:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Still simple to understand and easy to program.
    \end{itemize}

    Disadvantages:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Overhead still piles up, although less than processes.
      \item New complication: race conditions on shared data.
    \end{itemize}

    Each thread handles multiple connections.\\[1em]

    When a thread is ready, it uses select/poll to find work.\\

    \begin{itemize}
      \item perhaps it needs to read from disk into a mmap'd tempfile;
      \item perhaps it needs to copy the tempfile to the network.
    \end{itemize}~\\
    In either case, the thread does work and updates the request state.
