    Now\footnote{\url{http://www.quora.com/C++-programming-language/How-are-the-threading-and-memory-models-different-in-C++-as-compared-to-C}}:
    \begin{itemize}

    \item primitives: mutexes, atomics, memory barriers.
    \end{itemize}

    Previous example has undefined behaviour \\ \qquad per C++11. (why?)

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Language Support in C++11: Atomics}

  
    We've seen the notion of atomics. Here's the C++11 notation:

    \begin{lstlisting}
      atomic<int> foo, bar;      
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
      \begin{minipage}{.25\textwidth}
        Thread 1:
        \begin{lstlisting}
  foo.store(7);
  bar.store(42);
        \end{lstlisting}
      \end{minipage} &
      \begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
        Thread 2:
        \begin{lstlisting}
  printf("%d\n", foo.load());
  printf("%d\n", bar.load());
        \end{lstlisting}
      \end{minipage}
    \end{tabular}

    What are the possible outputs? (good exam question!)

  \frametitle{Prefix and Postfix}

  

  Lots of people use postfix out of habit, but prefix is better.\\[2em]

  In C, this isn't a problem. \\[1em]
  In some languages (like C++), it can be.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Why? Overloading}

  

  In C++, you can overload the {\tt ++} and {\tt --} operators.

  \begin{lstlisting}
class X {
public:
  X& operator++();
  const X operator++(int);
...
};

X x;
++x; // x.operator++();
x++; // x.operator++(0);
  \end{lstlisting}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Common Increment Implementations}

  

  Prefix is also known as {\bf increment and fetch}.

  \begin{lstlisting}
X& X::operator++()
{
  *this += 1;
  return *this;
}
  \end{lstlisting}
~\\[1em]

  Postfix is also known as {\bf fetch and increment}.

  \begin{lstlisting}
const X X::operator++(int)
{
  const X old = *this;
  ++(*this);
  return old;
}
  \end{lstlisting}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Efficiency}

  
  If you're the least concerned about efficiency, always use
  {\bf prefix} increments/decrements instead of defaulting to postfix.\\[1em]

  Only use {\tt postfix} when you really mean it, to be on the safe side.

  \frametitle{Locking}

  
  Locks prevent data races.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Locks' extents constitute their {\bf granularity}---do you lock large sections of your program with a big lock, or do you divide the locks and protect smaller sections?
  \end{itemize}

  Concerns when using locks:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item overhead;
    \item contention; and
    \item deadlocks.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Locking: Overhead}

  

  Using a lock isn't free. You pay:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item allocated memory for the locks;
    \item initialization and destruction time; and
    \item acquisition and release time.
  \end{itemize}

  These costs scale with the number of locks that you have.
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Locking: Contention}

  
    Most locking time is wasted waiting for the lock to become available.

    How can we fix this?
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Make the locking regions smaller (more granular);
        \item Make more locks for independent sections.
      \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Locking: Deadlocks}

  
  The more locks you have, the more you have to worry about deadlocks.\\[1em]

  Key condition: \\ 
\qquad waiting for a lock held by process $X$ \\while holding
a lock held by process $X'$. ($X = X'$ allowed).
  

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Formal Deadlock Definition}

The four conditions for deadlock are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Mutual Exclusion}
	\item \textbf{Hold-and-Wait}
	\item \textbf{No Preemption}
	\item \textbf{Circular-Wait}
\end{enumerate}



\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Does this look familiar?}

  
     Consider two processors trying to get two {\it locks}:
     
     \vfill
  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.4\textwidth}
      {\bf Thread 1}

      \verb+Get Lock 1+

      \verb+Get Lock 2+

      \verb+Release Lock 2+

      \verb+Release Lock 1+
    \column{0.4\textwidth}
      {\bf Thread 2}

      \verb+Get Lock 2+

      \verb+Get Lock 1+

      \verb+Release Lock 1+

      \verb+Release Lock 2+
    \end{columns}~\\[1em]
     Processor 1 gets Lock 1, then Processor 2 gets Lock 2. Oops!
          They both wait for each other \structure{(deadlock)}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Key to Preventing Deadlock}

  

  Always be careful if \\
your code {\bf acquires a lock while holding one}.\\[1em]

  Here's how to prevent a deadlock:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Ensure consistent ordering in acquiring locks; or
    \item Use {\tt trylock}.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Preventing Deadlocks---Ensuring Consistent Ordering}

  
  \begin{lstlisting}
void f1() {
    lock(&l1);
    lock(&l2);
    // protected code
    unlock(&l2);
    unlock(&ll);    
}

void f2() {
    lock(&l1);
    lock(&l2);
    // protected code
    unlock(&l2);
    unlock(&ll);    
}
  \end{lstlisting}

     This code will not deadlock: you can only get {\bf l2} if you have
      {\bf l1}.
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Formal Lock Ordering}


If the set of all resources in the system is $R = \{R_{0}, R_{1}, R_{2}, ... R_{m}\}$:

Assign to each resource $R_{k}$ a unique integer value. Let us define this function as $f(R_{i})$, that maps a resource to an integer value. 

This integer value is used to compare two resources: if a process has been assigned resource $R_{i}$, that process may request $R_{j}$ only if $f(R_{j}) > f(R_{i})$. 

If the process needs more than one of $R_{i}$ then the request for all of these must be made at once (in a single request). 

To get $R_{i}$ when already in possession of a resource $R_{j}$ where $f(R_{j}) > f(R_{i})$, the process must release any resources $R_{k}$ where $f(R_{k}) \geq f(R_{i})$. 

If these two protocols are followed, then a circular-wait condition cannot hold.



\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Preventing Deadlocks---Using {\tt trylock}}

  
  Recall: Pthreads' {\tt trylock} returns 0 if it gets the lock.

  \begin{lstlisting}
void f1() {
    lock(&l1);
    while (trylock(&l2) != 0) {
        unlock(&l1);
        // wait
        lock(&l1);
    }
    // protected code
    unlock(&l2);
    unlock(&ll);    
}
  \end{lstlisting}

    This code also won't deadlock: it will give up {\bf l1} if it can't get
    {\bf l2}.\\[1em]

    (BTW: trylocks also enable measuring lock contention.)

  \frametitle{Coarse-Grained Locking Example---Python GIL}

  
  This is the main reason (most) scripting languages have poor parallel
  performance; Python's just an example.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Python puts a lock around the whole interpreter\\ \quad (global interpreter lock).

    \item Only performance benefit you'll see from threading is if a thread is
      waiting for IO.

    \item Any non-I/O-bound threaded program will be {\bf slower} than the sequential
      version (plus, it'll slow down your system).

  \vfill
  {\bf Disadvantages}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item May be mostly wasted memory / setup time.
    \item Prone to deadlocks.
    \item Generally more error-prone (be sure you grab the right lock!)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Fine-Grained Locking Examples}

  
    The Linux kernel used to have {\bf one big lock}\\ that essentially made
      the kernel sequential. 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item (worked fine for single-processor systems!)
    \end{itemize}
    Now uses finer-grained locks for performance.\\[2em]

    Databases may lock fields / records / tables.\\
