\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Introduction to gperftools}

  
    Google Performance Tools include:
      
      \begin{itemize}
        \item CPU profiler.
        \item Heap profiler.
        \item Heap checker.
        \item Faster (multithreaded) {\tt malloc}.
      \end{itemize}
~\\[1em]
     We'll mostly use the CPU profiler:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item purely statistical sampling;
        \item no recompilation; at most linking; and
        \item built-in visual output.
      \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Google Perf Tools profiler usage}

  
    You can use the profiler without any recompilation.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Not recommended---worse data.
      \end{itemize}

  \begin{lstlisting}
LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/libprofiler.so" \
CPUPROFILE=test.prof ./test
  \end{lstlisting}

     The other option is to link to the profiler:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item {\tt -lprofiler}
      \end{itemize}
    Both options read the {\tt CPUPROFILE} environment variable:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item states the location to write the profile data.
      \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Other Usage}

  
     You can use the profiling library directly as well:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item {\tt \#include <gperftools/profiler.h>}
      \end{itemize}
     Bracket code you want profiled with:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item {\tt ProfilerStart()}
        \item {\tt ProfilerStop()}
      \end{itemize}~\\
    
    You can change the sampling frequency with the
      {\tt CPUPROFILE\_FREQUENCY} environment variable.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf Default value:} 100
      \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{{\tt pprof} Usage}


    Like {\tt gprof}, it will analyze profiling results.

  \begin{lstlisting}
% pprof test test.prof
    Enters "interactive" mode
% pprof --text test test.prof
    Outputs one line per procedure
% pprof --gv test test.prof
     Displays annotated call-graph via 'gv'
% pprof --gv --focus=Mutex test test.prof
    Restricts to code paths including a .*Mutex.* entry
% pprof --gv --focus=Mutex --ignore=string test test.prof
    Code paths including Mutex but not string
% pprof --list=getdir test test.prof
    (Per-line) annotated source listing for getdir()
% pprof --disasm=getdir test test.prof
    (Per-PC) annotated disassembly for getdir()
  \end{lstlisting}

    Can also output {\tt dot}, {\tt ps}, {\tt pdf} or {\tt gif} instead of
      {\tt gv}.
  

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Text Output}


    Similar to the flat profile in {\tt gprof}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Graphical Output Explained}

  
  Output was too small to read on the slide.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Shows the same numbers as the text output.
    \item Directed edges denote function calls.
    \item Note: number of samples in callees = \\
      \qquad number in ``this function + callees'' - \\
      \qquad number in ``this function''.\\
    \item {\bf Example:}\\
{{\tt float\_math\_helper}, 51 (local) of 96 (cumulative)} \\
      96 - 51 = 45 (callees)
      \begin{itemize}
        \item callee {\tt int\_power} = 7 (bogus)
        \item callee {\tt float\_power} = 38
        \item callees total = 45
      \end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Things You May Notice}

  
    Call graph is not exact.
    
      \begin{itemize}
        \item In fact, it shows many bogus relations which clearly don't exist.
        \item For instance, we know that there are no cross-calls between {\tt int} and {\tt float} functions.
      \end{itemize}~\\

    As with {\tt gprof}, optimizations will change the
      graph.\\[1em]

    You'll probably want to look at the text profile first, then use the
      {\tt --focus} flag to look at individual functions.

  \frametitle{DTrace: Introduction}


    \url{http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1117401}\\[1em]

    Intrumentation-based tool.\\
    System-wide.\\
    Meant to be used on production systems. (Eh?)\\[1em]
     \only<2>{
     {\small (Typical instrumentation can have a slowdown of 100x (Valgrind).)}\\
     Design goals:\\
\begin{enumerate} 
\item No overhead when not in use;
\item Guarantee safety---must not crash\\ \qquad (strict limits on expressiveness of probes).
\end{enumerate}
     }

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{DTrace: Operation}


    How does DTrace achieve 0 overhead?\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item only when activated, dynamically rewrites code by placing a branch to
      instrumentation code.
\end{itemize}

    Uninstrumented: runs as if nothing changed.\\[1em]

    Most instrumentation: at function entry or exit points.\\
    You can also instrument kernel functions, locking, instrument-based
      on other events.\\[1em]

    Can express sampling as instrumentation-based events also.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{DTrace Example}


  You write this:

  \begin{lstlisting}
syscall::read:entry {
    self->t = timestamp;
}

syscall::read:return
/self->t/ {
    printf("%d/%d spent %d nsecs in read\n"
           pid, tid, timestamp - self->t);
}
  \end{lstlisting}

    {\tt t} is a thread-local variable.\\
    This code prints how long each call to {\tt read} takes, along with
      context.\\[1em]
    To ensure safety, DTrace limits what you write; e.g. no loops.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item (Hence, no infinite loops!)
      \end{itemize}

  Enables WAIT to compute a ``wait state'' (using expert-written rules): \\
what the process is currently doing or waiting on, e.g.
\begin{itemize}
\item disk;
\item GC;
\item network; 
\item blocked;

Server provides
a report.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item You fix the performance problems.\\[1em]
\end{itemize}

Report indicates processor utilization (idle, your application, GC, 
etc); runnable threads; waiting threads (and why they are waiting); 
thread states; and a stack viewer.\\[1em]

Paper presents 6 case studies where WAIT identified performance
problems: deadlocks, server underloads, memory leaks, database
bottlenecks, and excess filesystem activity.
