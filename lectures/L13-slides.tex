\end{frame}
  

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Breaking Dependencies}

We need not wait for the branch to be evaluated.

We'll use speculation at a coarser-grained level: speculatively parallelize code.

Two ways: \alert{speculative execution} and
      \alert{value speculation}.
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Speculative Execution: Example}

  
Consider the following code:
  
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
void doWork(int x, int y) {
    int value = longCalculation(x, y);
    if (value > threshold) {
      return value + secondLongCalculation(x, y);
    }
    else {
      return value;
    }
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  Will we need to run {\tt secondLongCalculation}?
  \vfill  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<2> OK, so: could we execute {\tt longCalculation} and {\tt secondLongCalculation}
      in parallel if we didn't have the conditional?
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Speculative Execution: Assume No Conditional}

  
  Yes, we could parallelize them. Consider this code:
    
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
  void doWork(int x, int y) {
    thread_t t1, t2;
    point p(x,y);
    int v1, v2;
    thread_create(&t1, NULL, &longCalculation, &p);
    thread_create(&t2, NULL, &secondLongCalculation, &p);
    thread_join(t1, &v1);
    thread_join(t2, &v2);
    if (v1 > threshold) {
      return v1 + v2;
    } else {
      return v1;
    }
  }
    \end{lstlisting}

  We do both the calculations in parallel and return the same result as before.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item What are we assuming about {\tt longCalculation} and
{\tt secondLongCalculation}?
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Estimating Impact of Speculative Execution}

  
  $T_1$: time to run {\tt longCalculation}.

  $T_2$: time to run {\tt secondLongCalculation}.

  $p$: probability that {\tt secondLongCalculation} executes.\\[1em]

  In the normal case we have:
    \[T_{\mbox{\scriptsize normal}} = T_1 + pT_2.\]

  $S$: synchronization overhead.\\
  Our speculative code takes:
    \[ T_{\mbox{\scriptsize speculative}} = \mbox{max}(T_1, T_2) + S.\]

    \structure{Exercise.} When is speculative code faster? Slower? \\ How could you improve it?

  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Shortcomings of Speculative Execution}

  
  Consider the following code:
  
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
void doWork(int x, int y) {
    int value = longCalculation(x, y);
    return secondLongCalculation(value);
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  Now we have a true dependency; can't use speculative~execution.\\[1em]

  But: if the value is predictable, we can execute
      {\tt secondLongCalculation} using the predicted value.\\[1em]

  This is \structure{value speculation}.
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Value Speculation Implementation}

% note: v1 is meant to be the result you get from longCalculation this time, while last_value is what you got last time. (The code doesn't show that). If you get the same result from longCalculation this time as you did last time, then secondLongCalculation is correct and you don't need to redo it.
  
  This Pthread code does value speculation:
  
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
void doWork(int x, int y) {
    thread_t t1, t2;
    point p(x,y);
    int v1, v2, last_value;
    thread_create(&t1, NULL, &longCalculation, &p);
    thread_create(&t2, NULL, &secondLongCalculation,
                  &last_value);
    thread_join(t1, &v1);
    thread_join(t2, &v2);
    if (v1 == last_value) {
      return v2;
    } else {
      last_value = v1;
      return secondLongCalculation(v1);
    }
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  Note: this is like memoization (plus parallelization).
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Estimating Impact of Value Speculation}

  
  $T_1$: time to run {\tt longCalculatuion}.

  $T_2$: time to run {\tt secondLongCalculation}.

  $p$: probability that {\tt secondLongCalculation} executes again.

  $S$: synchronization overhead.\\[1em]

  In the normal case, we have:
    \[ T = T_1 +T_2.\]

  This speculative code takes:
    \[ T = \mbox{max}(T_1, T_2) + S + pT_2.\]

    \structure{Exercise.} Again, when is speculative code faster? Slower? How could you improve it?

  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{When Can We Speculate?}

  
  Required conditions for safety:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt longCalculation} and {\tt secondLongCalculation} must not call
      each other.
    \item {\tt secondLongCalculation} must not depend on
      any values set or modified by {\tt longCalculation}.
    \item The return value of {\tt longCalculation} must be deterministic.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Side Effects}

As a general warning: Consider the \alert{side effects} of function calls. 

They have a big impact on parallelism. Side effects are problematic, but why? 

For one thing they're kind of unpredictable. 

Side effects are changes in state that do not depend on the function input. 

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Side Effects}

Calling a function or expression has a side effect if it has some visible effect on the outside world. 

Some things necessarily have side effects, like printing to the console. 

Others are side effects which may be avoidable if we can help it, like modifying a global variable.

  \frametitle{STM: Introduction}


    Instead of programming with locks, we have transactions on memory.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Analogous to database transactions
      \end{itemize}
    An old idea; recently saw some renewed interest.\\[1em]

    A series of memory operations either all succeed; or \\ \qquad
     all fail (and get
      rolled back), and are later retried.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{STM: Benefits}


    Simple programming model: need not worry about lock
      granularity or deadlocks.\\[1em]

    Just group lines of code that should logically be one operation
      in an {\tt atomic} block!\\[1em]

    It is the responsibility of the implementer to ensure the code
      operates as an atomic transaction.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{STM: Implementing a Motivating Example}


  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
transfer_funds(Account* sender, Account* receiver,
               double amount) {
  atomic {
    sender->funds -= amount;
    receiver->funds += amount;
  }
}
  \end{lstlisting}
  [Note: bank transfers aren't actually atomic!]\\[1em]

    With locks we have two main options:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Lock everything to do with modifying accounts \\ 
\qquad (slow; may forget to use lock).
        \item Have a lock for every account \\ 
\qquad (deadlocks; may forget to use lock).
      \end{itemize}
    With STM, we do not have to worry about remembering to acquire locks,
      or about deadlocks.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{STM: Drawbacks}


    Rollback is key to STM. \\
     \qquad But, some things cannot be rolled back. \\
     \qquad (write to the screen, send packet over network)\\[1em]

    Nested transactions. \\
     \qquad What if an inner transaction succeeds, \\ yet the
      transaction aborts? \\[1em]

    Limited transaction size: \\
 \qquad Most implementations (especially
    all-hardware) \\ have a limited transaction size.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Basic STM Implementation (Software)}


    In all atomic blocks, record all reads/writes to a log.\\[1em]
    At the end of the block, running thread verifies that no other threads
      have modified any values read.\\[1em]
    If validation is successful, changes are {\bf committed}.\\
    Otherwise, the block is {\bf aborted} and re-executed.\\[2em]

  Note: Hardware implementations exist too.



\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Basic STM Implementation Issues}


    Since you don't protect against dataraces (just rollback),\\
      a datarace may trigger a fatal error in your program.

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
atomic {
  x++;
  y++;
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
atomic {
  if (x != y)
     while (true) { }
}
  \end{lstlisting}

 In this silly example, assume initially {\tt x = y}. You may think the
      code will not go into an infinite loop, but it can.

  Note: Typically STM performance is no worse than twice as slow as
  fine-grained locks.

     Software Transactional Memory provides a more natural approach to
      parallel programming: \\ \qquad no need to deal with locks and their associated problems.\\[1em]

     Currently slow,\\ \qquad but a lot of research is going into improving it. (futile?)\\[1em]

     Operates by either completing an atomic block,\\ or retrying (by rolling
      back) until it successfully completes.
