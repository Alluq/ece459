\frametitle{New Considerations}

New considerations -- or complications -- arise.

We'll talk about two settings, one that I love and one that I hate: food halls and Service Ontario. 
 
No points for guessing which is which.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Multiple Services}

At Service Ontario, every staff member can help you with any task.

But at the food hall, the Gelato place cannot provide tacos.

Are tacos and gelato interchangeable? Maybe...

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Maintenance, Planned and Unplanned}

Services have downtime, both planned and unplanned.

If the pizza oven breaks, no more pizza today.

Usually we do not think about unplanned downtime in service capacity design.


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{New Things Too?}

New services can appear: what if a Banh Mi place opens?

\end{center}

Restaurant opening is rarely a surprise...


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Interchangeability}

Interchangeability of services is a spectrum:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Full; Starving? Tacos, pizza, shawarma? Just feed me now! \vspace{5em}
	\item Partial; Just a bit hungry? Want tacos, would have shawarma. \vspace{5em}
	\item None; I came for tacos and want nothing else.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Nutritionist}

All the food hall examples are about food -- at least the possibility of interchangeability exists.

But: I came for a drivers' license; a new health card is not a possible substitute.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Too Long}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/longline.jpg}
\end{center}


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Three Kinds of Problem}

Balking: don't get in the line at all.


Reneging: get in line, get frustrated, leave.


Loss: No capacity, request to enqueue refused (M/M/k/k system).


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{How Long Now?}

In both cases where I choose to leave, there is an implicit or explicit calculation -- what would I calculate?


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{How Long Now?}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/calculate-wait.jpg}
\end{center}

Compare the calculated value with my willingness to wait...

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{I Got It Wrong?}

One possibility: my estimate of service time or queue length wrong.

What if people can join the line ahead of me?

\end{center}


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Priority}

Priorities for queueing may exist: some can go to the front of the line!

Example: people with mobility restrictions at Service Ontario.

This makes my wait longer and might make give up waiting.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Priorities are Interesting}

Priorities open up new questions, such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How much, if any, does giving priority to one group over another help the group being given priority? \vspace{3em}
	\item How much, if any, does giving priority to one group disadvantage the group not being given priority?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Priorities are Interesting}

Priorities open up new questions, such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Can the priority system incentivize people to choose things that are less popular? \vspace{3em}
	\item Recognizing that if everyone has priority, nobody has priority, how many requests can have priority before all benefit is lost?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Laboratory Study with a Mouse}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/themouse.jpg}
\end{center}

Yes. That mouse.
