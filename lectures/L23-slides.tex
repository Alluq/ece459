    Implication: require more circuitry to break passwords.\\

    \begin{defn}
      A \emph{memory-hard} algorithm on a Random Access Machine is an
      algorithm which uses $S(n)$ space and $T(n)$ operations, where
      $S(n) \in \Omega(T(n)^{1-\varepsilon})$.
    \end{defn}~\\

    A \emph{sequential memory-hard function} is one where:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item the fastest
        sequential algorithm is memory-hard; and
      \item it is impossible for a
        parallel algorithm to asymptotically achieve lower cost.

  \frametitle{Trading Accuracy for Performance}


    Consider Monte Carlo integration.\\
    It illustrates a general tradeoff: accuracy vs performance.\\
    You'll also implement this tradeoff manually in A4 \\ \qquad (with domain knowledge).\\[1em]

    Martin Rinard generalized the accuracy vs performance tradeoff with:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item early phase termination [OOPSLA07]
        \item loop perforation [CSAIL TR 2009]
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Early Phase Termination}



  We've seen barriers before.\\

  No thread may proceed past a barrier until all of the threads
reach the barrier.\\[1em]

  This may slow down the program: maybe one of the threads is horribly
  slow.\\[1em]

  Solution: kill the slowest thread.

  \frametitle{Early Phase Termination: When is it OK anyway?}


OK, so we don't want to be completely crazy.\\[1em]

Instead: 
\begin{itemize}
\item develop a statistical model of the program behaviour.
\item only kill tasks that don't introduce unacceptable distortions.
\end{itemize}

~\\[1em]

When we run the program: \\ \qquad get the output, plus a confidence interval.

  \frametitle{Early Phase Termination: Two Examples}



Monte Carlo simulators: \\
Raytracers:
\begin{itemize}
\item already picking points randomly.
\end{itemize}

In both cases: spawn a lot of threads.\\[1em]
Could wait for all threads to complete;\\
or just compensate for missing data points,\\
assuming they look like points you did compute.


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Early Phase Termination: Another Justification}



In scientific computations:
\begin{itemize}
\item using points that were measured (subject to error);
\item computing using machine numbers (also with error). 
\end{itemize}

Computers are only providing simulations, not ground truth.

Actual question: is the simulation is good enough?

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Loop Perforation}


  Like early-phase termination, but for sequential programs:\\
  \qquad throw away data that's not actually useful.

  \begin{lstlisting}
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) sum += numbers[i];
  \end{lstlisting}

  \begin{center}
    $\Downarrow$
  \end{center}

  \begin{lstlisting}
for (i = 0; i < n; i += 2) sum += numbers[i];
sum *= 2;
  \end{lstlisting}

  This gives a speedup of $\sim$ 2 if {\tt numbers[]} is nice.\\[1em]

  Works for video encoding: can't observe difference.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Applications of Reduced Resource Computation}


  Loop perforation works for:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item evaluating forces on water molecules (summing numbers);
   \item Monte-Carlo simulation of swaption pricing;
   \item video encoding.
  \end{itemize}

  More on the video encoding example:\\
  Changing loop increments from 4 to 8 gives:
\begin{itemize}
 \item speedup of 1.67;
 \item signal-to-noise ratio decrease of 0.87\%;
 \item bitrate increase of 18.47\%;
 \item visually indistinguishable results.
\end{itemize}

  if (min < sum) {
    min = sum;
    index = i;
  }

The optimization changes the loop increments and then compensates.

\part{Software Transactional Memory}
\frame{\partpage}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{STM: Introduction}


    Instead of programming with locks, we have transactions on memory.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Analogous to database transactions
      \end{itemize}
    An old idea; recently saw some renewed interest.\\[1em]

    A series of memory operations either all succeed; or \\ \qquad
     all fail (and get
      rolled back), and are later retried.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{STM: Benefits}


    Simple programming model: need not worry about lock
      granularity or deadlocks.\\[1em]

    Just group lines of code that should logically be one operation
      in an {\tt atomic} block!\\[1em]

    It is the responsibility of the implementer to ensure the code
      operates as an atomic transaction.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{STM: Implementing a Motivating Example}


  \begin{lstlisting}
transfer_funds(Account* sender, Account* receiver,
               double amount) {
  atomic {
    sender->funds -= amount;
    receiver->funds += amount;
  }
}
  \end{lstlisting}
  [Note: bank transfers aren't actually atomic!]\\[1em]

    With locks we have two main options:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Lock everything to do with modifying accounts \\ 
\qquad (slow; may forget to use lock).
        \item Have a lock for every account \\ 
\qquad (deadlocks; may forget to use lock).
      \end{itemize}
    With STM, we do not have to worry about remembering to acquire locks,
      or about deadlocks.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{STM: Drawbacks}


    Rollback is key to STM. \\
     \qquad But, some things cannot be rolled back. \\
     \qquad (write to the screen, send packet over network)\\[1em]

    Nested transactions. \\
     \qquad What if an inner transaction succeeds, \\ yet the
      transaction aborts? \\[1em]

    Limited transaction size: \\
 \qquad Most implementations (especially
    all-hardware) \\ have a limited transaction size.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Basic STM Implementation (Software)}


    In all atomic blocks, record all reads/writes to a log.\\[1em]
    At the end of the block, running thread verifies that no other threads
      have modified any values read.\\[1em]
    If validation is successful, changes are {\bf committed}.\\
    Otherwise, the block is {\bf aborted} and re-executed.\\[2em]

  Note: Hardware implementations exist too.



\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Basic STM Implementation Issues}


    Since you don't protect against dataraces (just rollback),\\
      a datarace may trigger a fatal error in your program.

  \begin{lstlisting}
atomic {
  x++;
  y++;
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  \begin{lstlisting}
atomic {
  if (x != y)
     while (true) { }
}
  \end{lstlisting}

 In this silly example, assume initially {\tt x = y}. You may think the
      code will not go into an infinite loop, but it can.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  Note: Typically STM performance is no worse than twice as slow as
  fine-grained locks.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Toward.Boost.STM (C++)

    \item SXM (Microsoft, C\#)

    \item Built-in to the language (Clojure, Haskell)

    \item Durus (Python)
  \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{STM Summary}


     Software Transactional Memory provides a more natural approach to
      parallel programming: \\ \qquad no need to deal with locks and their associated problems.\\[1em]

     Currently slow,\\ \qquad but a lot of research is going into improving it. (futile?)\\[1em]

     Operates by either completing an atomic block,\\ or retrying (by rolling
      back) until it successfully completes.
