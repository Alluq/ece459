# Lecture 35 â€” DevOps: Operations

## Roadmap

I thought of 3 potential exercises in this DevOps space. We can look at them and decide which order to do them in (and how many to do).

## Naming

Let's develop a naming scheme for our herds of (literal) cows. How can we apply the principles in the lecture to
this problem?

## Dockerization

This is pretty cookbook, but you can follow these instructions for creating a Docker image of a Node.js
application.

## GitHub Actions

I figured out how to use GitHub Actions to compile the TeX files automatically. Probably the easiest CI thing is to
run test cases for a project automatically. Pick some Java project and set up a GitHub action for it.
