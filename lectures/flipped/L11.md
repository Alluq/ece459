# Lecture 11 â€” Lock Convoys, Atomics, Lock-Freedom

## Lock Convoys

Activity: given a lock (say a piece of paper), some students play as threads
with the same priority and one student as the scheduler, then they act the
following.

- Once the lock is free, a random thread picks up the lock then informs the
  scheduler to pick up the next thread to run.
- The scheduler don't see which thread owns the lock. It picks the next-to-run
  thread randomly.

Let's see how many times the scheduler picks the wrong thread to run.

## Try-lock

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let mut retries = 0;
    let retries_limit = 10;
    let counter = Mutex::new(0);

    loop {
        if retries < retries_limit {
            let l = counter.try_lock();
            // ^ try_lock helps since if A is going to release the critical
            // section, B does not immediately become the owner and A may keep
            // running and A might even get the critical section again during
            // the same time slice before B tries again to acquire the lock (and
            // may succeed).
            if l.is_ok() {
                *l.unwrap() = 1;
                break;
            } else {
                retries = retries + 1;
                thread::yield_now();
                // ^ give up the remaining time slice
            }
        } else {
            *counter.lock().unwrap() = 1;
            break;
        }
    }
    println!("done");
}
```

## Atomics

### load and store

```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};

fn main() {
    let b = AtomicBool::new(false);
    b.store(true, Ordering::SeqCst);
    println!("{}", b.load(Ordering::SeqCst));
}
```

### compare and exchange

Implementing a spinlock

```rust
use std::{hint, sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering}};

fn main() {
    let my_lock = AtomicBool::new(false);
    // ... Other stuff happens
    while my_lock.compare_exchange(false, true, Ordering::SeqCst, Ordering::SeqCst) == Ok(true) {
        // ^ note that compare_and_swap() is deprecated since 1.50.0
        // The lock was 'true', someone else has the lock, so try again
        hint::spin_loop();
    }
    // Inside critical section
    my_lock.store(false, Ordering::SeqCst);
}
```

### ABA problem

## Lock Freedom

Discuss about non-blocking, blocking, lock-free, and waiting. See
<https://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/threading/non_blocking_lock_free_and_wait_free.html>

Talk about the lock-free stack?

Question: Are lock-free programming techniques somehow better for performance?
