# L21 Performance Case Study, Performance Culture

## Roadmap

We have a case study about performance work in Firefox and then some 
discussion about the softer side of software engineering&mdash;how to
ensure that your software is performance.

## Performance Case Study [10 minutes]

Let's consider the code changes discussed in this [Firefox performance update](https://mikeconley.ca/blog/2018/02/14/firefox-performance-update-1/). Put the ideas into into categories:

* do less work (or do it sooner/later);
* use threads (move work off main thread);
* track performance;

Can you think of another example of a change that you've seen in each of the categories?

## Performance Laws / Tips / Culture [20 minutes]

what performance improvements have you seen in your coop jobs?
talk about how they came to happen.

* what do you think about language choice?
* have you observed small details or resource usage issues?
* have you done experiments?
* more hardware: a blessing or a curse?
* what order of magnitude have you worked with?
* Culture: have you seen any of the warning signs? what metrics have you seen?
