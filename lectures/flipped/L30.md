# L30 Clusters and Cloud Computing

## Roadmap
Kafka, clouds, and clusters vs laptops.

## Kafka [10 minutes]

We will play with the parameters here:

and gain some understanding of how Kafka works.

## Cloud computing: when to use? [10 minutes]

In the notes, I talked about using Amazon EC2 vs ecetesla machines. Calculate the relative
costs of using EC2 vs buying machines with Teslas (you'll need to estimate usage.)

## Clusters vs laptops [5 minutes]

Why are clusters sometimes so slow?

## Movie Hour

See the link in the lecture notes.
