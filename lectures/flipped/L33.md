# L33 More Advanced Queueing Theory

## Roadmap

We will discuss the new considerations that may cause complications in queueing theory, then we will do some simulation exercises.

## New considerations/complications [10 minutes]

Let's discuss possible complications to queueing theory, which should collectively form the points mentioned in the lecture notes.

## Simulations [20 minutes]

Checkout the original code <https://github.com/TouringPlans/shapeland>. If you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab <https://jupyter.org/>, you can run it directly. Otherwise, you can use the python script I put together in `flipped/L33/amusement_park_sim.py`. Move it into the shapeland repo that you have cloned to run it. You may need to use `pip` to install the necessary dependencies.

Note that there's a plot about "age class", but we don't use it so we don't need to care about it.

Change the `RNG_SEED = 5` to a different value and try exploring following settings:

* 20,000 agents and keep other parameters unchanged (Default is `TOTAL_DAILY_AGENTS = 2000`, which doesn't make sense).
* 20,000 agents, single attraction, and single activity
* 5,000 agents, single attraction, and single activity (much less workload in this case)
* Try tweaking other parameters

(I put some sample plots in `flipped/L33`, see if they are different from yours)
