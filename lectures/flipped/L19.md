# Lecture 19 â€” Query Optimization

Activity: inside `flipped/L19`, there are two tables, `customer` and `orders`.
Now, two students look at each table separately, and try to return the results
of the following:

* The joined table containing all information
* The customer names who have at least one order with over 1000 dollars

Question: How can we retrieve the results for the second query faster? and with
less storage space?
