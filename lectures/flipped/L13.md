# Lecture 13 â€” Early Termination, Reduced-Resource Computation

## Roadmap

We will talk about two ideas: 1) to skip some parts of work; and 2)
intentionally reduce accuracy to speed things up.

## N-body problem

Simple ideas: computing the forces in parallel, using `float` instead of
`double`, etc.

### live-coding

(See `live-coding/L13`)

Walk through the N-body code

Walk through the N-body code with bins, talk about the differences

Compare the runtimes

## Other

Talk about the **fast inverse square root** in Quoke III (very interesting!) and
**loop perforation** if time permits.

# After-action report, huanyi, 08Feb23

Went through all the n-body sample codes. However, it turns out the bin version
does not speed up much. Need to take a look sometime later.

# After-action report, plam, 10Feb23

Gave the example of Lab 2 and not requiring exact answers.

Showed the Rubik's Cube example (it's not a great visualization).

Did not do the sqrt example in detail.

Talked about N-body problem and the old Lab 3.

Loop perforation: talked about an example of summing a bunch of numbers.
