# L25 Profilers, Profile Guided Optimization

## Roadmap

Two exercises: one for systemtap and one for profiler guided optimization.

## Systemtap (25 minutes)

I couldn't figure out how to run the real dtrace on my Debian machines (or on the ECE machines), but I can run systemtap, which seems to have similar functionality. You can read about SystemTap in this 
2021 article: [Using the SystemTap Dyninst runtime environment](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/16/using-the-systemtap-dyninst-runtime-environment#), and there is a somewhat stale [beginners 
guide](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/SystemTap_Beginners_Guide/), though I had to use Google to figure out how to get the example to run today, using the [release notes for 
4.1](https://lwn.net/Articles/787810/).

Here's some Hello, World content:

```
sudo apt install linux-image-5.16.0-5-amd64-dbg linux-headers-5.16.0-5-amd64
sudo apt install systemtap

sudo stap -v -e 'probe oneshot { println("hello world") }'
sudo stap -ve 'probe kernel.function("icmp_reply") { println("icmp reply") }'
```

and here I invoke a more sophisticated script, which I fixed from the Beginners' Guide, and committed to the course repo under `lectures/flipped/L26/iotime.stp`.
```
sudo stap iotime.stp -c 'grep foobar /var/cache/apt/archives/[put some file here]'
```

It should be possible to count the number of calls to `clone()`, the system call to create threads in Linux, on the Lab 4 code, which is otherwise kind of hard to do. Got to run it in the A4 directory though.

```
sudo stap ~/courses/ece459/lectures/flipped/L26/clone.stp -c '/home/plam/hacking/ece459-a4/target/release/lab4'
```

(The starter code for A4 is at [https://git.uwaterloo.ca/ece459-rust-assignments/ece459-a4]).
