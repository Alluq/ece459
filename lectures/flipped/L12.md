# Lecture 12 â€” Dependencies and Speculation

## Dependencies

Talk about loop-carried and memory-carried dependencies.

## Breaking Dependencies with Speculation

### Speculative Execution for Threads

Exercise: consider the following code, if you can create extra threads to
calculate the results of `long_calculation` and `second_long_calculation`, how
can you speed up the code potentially?

```rust
fn do_work(x: i32, y: i32, threshold: i32) -> i32 {
    let val = long_calculation(x, y);
    if val > threshold {
        return val + second_long_calculation(x, y);
    }
    return val;
}
```

Question: when is your modified code faster? When is it slower? How could you
improve the use of threads?

### Value Speculation

Exercise: consider the following code, if you can somehow predict the result of
`long_calculation`, how can you speed up the code potentially?

```rust
fn do_other_work(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    let val = long_calculation(x, y);
    return second_long_calculation(val);
}
```

Question: when is your modified code faster? When is it slower? How could you
improve the use of threads?

# After-action report, plam, 10Feb23

Gave examples of memory-carried dependencies, and loop-carried dependencies (Lab 2).

Speculation: worked through calculating the expected runtime.

STM: we can probably drop this topic, it's not hot anymore. Mentioned it briefly.
