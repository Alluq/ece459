# Lecture 28 â€” Causal and Memory Profiling

## Roadmap

We'll experiment with using DHAT and Massif on the Lab 4 code.

## DHAT [20 minutes]

Here's the instructions for DHAT:
[https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/dh-manual.html]. (There's also the dhat-rs
crate: [https://docs.rs/dhat/latest/dhat/], but that's a bit harder to use, but
it's supposed to be faster). Run DHAT on your Lab 4 code.

Remember, you want

```
[profile.release]
debug = true
```

in your Cargo.toml. Hint: ecetesla2 is super slow, so if you run it with
parameters "5 5 5 5 5" it'll finish in about 2 minutes on that computer. I've
put the `dh_view.html` code at <https://patricklam.ca/tmp/dh_view.html>, or you
can try <https://nnethercote.github.io/dh_view/dh_view.html>, but you can also
copy it to your local machine from `/usr/libexec/valgrind` on the machine where
you run DHAT as well. You can run it with bigger numbers on, for instance,
ecetesla3.

## Massif [20 minutes]

Compile `live-coding/L28/alloc` and run it with `valgrind --tool=massif
target/release/alloc`. There will not be any useful output, but instead we can
find a `massif.out.[PID]` file. Use `ms_print` to read it.

Now try Massif and valgrind with your Lab 4.

We'll talk about what you've found. I've done it with the skeleton code.
