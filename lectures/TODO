More indepth on autoparallelization/vectorization

* note: everyone does vectorization -> more L17 content?
  https://llvm.org/docs/Vectorizers.html
* also, C++ parallel std libraries are a thing

How parallelization works:

Lecture 20: rework to use godbolt

Lecture 22: simple example should be C++ bindings, and should it be in the slides? Probably not. Maybe it's just the kind of thing that would benefit from live annotations of the code on the PDF.

think about 24-25 (profiling)
