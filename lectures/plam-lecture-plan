L01: slides
L02: slides
L03: blackboard/live coding
L04: slides
L05: slides / live coding
L06: definitely slides / live coding
L07: blackboard / live coding
L08: slides
L09: slides / live coding
L10: blackboard?
L11: probably best with blackboard and showing some pictures; be sure to have solaris installed somewhere
L12: slides / live coding
L13: board / live coding
L14: board, but simplify the code in the task examples for the board
L15: board
L16: dunno, probably too much content for the board (8 pages of written notes is not 1 hour!), but the material is good for the board
L17: use slides to get back on track after L16; could be done on the board, but that doesn't have so many benefits
L18: board / live coding
L19: slides for first half, maybe board for 2nd half (Stream VByte)
L20: should use godbolt/blackboard (TODO rework notes/slides for godbolt)
L21: it's all words, use the board
L22: probably the board, but re-think Part III simple example; it's C not C++ and it's a bunch of code anyways
L23: slides are OK
L24: slides / live coding
L25: slides
L26: live coding / some slides
L27: demos / board (what are the demos?)
L28: probably slides
L29: live coding / board (cloud computing) / movie
L30: slides
L31: slides (unless plam replaces with compilers bonus), I guess. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPxBKxU8GIQ
L32: slides
L33: slides
L34: movie
L35: mostly board, but keep the slides handy
