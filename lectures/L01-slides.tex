\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Making Programs Faster}
  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Increase bandwidth (tasks per unit time); or
    \item Decrease latency (time per task).
  \end{itemize}~\\[1em]
 {\bf Examples of bandwidth/latency:}\\Network (connection speed/ping),
          traffic (lanes/speed)
  \end{changemargin}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Our Focus}

\hspace*{.15\textwidth}\begin{minipage}{.8\textwidth}
  Primarily on increasing bandwidth (more tasks/unit~time).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Do tasks in parallel
  \end{itemize}
~\\[1em]
   Decreasing time/task usually harder, with
          fewer gains.\\[1em]
   CPUs have been going towards more cores rather than raw
          speed.\\[1em]
\end{minipage}

  \frametitle{A Bit on Improving Latency}

\hspace*{.15\textwidth}\begin{minipage}{.85\textwidth}
  We won't return to these topics, but we'll touch on them now.\\

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Profile the code;
    \vfill
    \item Do less work;
    \vfill
    \item Be smarter; or
    \vfill
    \item Improve the hardware.

  \frametitle{Intermission}

  While working on Assignment 1, I ran into this puzzle:

  \vspace*{1cm}\hspace*{1cm}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
   \draw (1,1) node[rectangle, fill=blue, minimum height=2cm, minimum width=3cm,draw] {};
   \draw (3,0.5) node[rectangle, fill=green, minimum height=0.75cm, minimum width=6cm,draw] {};
    \draw (-0.5,2.2) node {$(x_0, y_0)$};
    \draw (2.5,2.2) node {$(x_0+w_0, y_0)$};
    \draw (-0.5,-0.3) node {$(x_0, y_0+h_0)$};
    \draw (0.5,1.1) node[color=white] {$(x_1, y_1)$};
    \draw (6.5,1.1) node {$(x_1+w_1, y_1)$};
  \end{tikzpicture}

  When do these rectangles intersect?

  \frametitle{Increasing Bandwidth: Parallelism}

\hspace*{.2\textwidth}\begin{minipage}{.76\textwidth}
   Some tasks are easy to run in parallel. \\[1em]
   {\bf \hspace*{3em} Examples:} web server requests, computer graphics, brute-force searches,  genetic
          algorithms\\[2em]
 Others are more difficult.\\[1em]
    {\bf \hspace*{3em} Example:} linked list traversal (why?)

  \frametitle{Hardware}

\hspace*{.2\textwidth}\begin{minipage}{.76\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use pipelining (all modern CPU do this):
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement this in software by spliting a task into subtasks and
              running the subtasks in parallel
      \end{itemize}
    ~\\[1em]
    \item Increase the number of cores/CPUs.
    ~\\[1em]
    \item Use multiple connected machines.
    ~\\[1em]
    \item Use specialized hardware, such as a GPU which contains hundreds of
          simple cores.
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Barriers to parallelization}

\hspace*{.1\textwidth}\begin{minipage}{.85\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Independent tasks (``embarrassingly parallel problems'') are
      trivial to parallelize, but dependencies cause problems.\\[1em]
    \item Unable to start task until previous task finishes.\\[1em]
    \item May require synchronization and combination of results.\\[1em]
    \item More difficult to reason about, since execution may happen in any
          order.
  \end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Limitations}

\hspace*{.1\textwidth}\begin{minipage}{.85\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Sequential tasks in the problem will always dominate maximum
          performance\\[1em]
    \item Some sequential problems may be parallelizable by reformulating the
          implementation\\[1em]
    \item However, no matter how many processors you have, you won't be able to
          speed up the program as a whole (known as \structure{Amdahl's Law})
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Data Race}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Two processors accessing the same data.
    \vfill
    \item For example, consider the following code:

          \verb+x = 1+

          \verb+print x+

          \structure{You run it and see it prints 5}
    \vfill
    \item \structure{Why?} Before the print, another thread wrote a new value
          for \verb+x+. This is an example of a data race.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]
  \frametitle{Deadlock}

Two processors trying to access a shared resource.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Consider two processors trying to get two resources:
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.4\textwidth}
      {\bf Processor 1}
      \verb+Get Resource 1+
      \verb+Get Resource 2+
      \verb+Release Resource 2+
      \verb+Release Resource 1+
    \column{0.4\textwidth}
      {\bf Processor 2}
      \verb+Get Resource 2+
      \verb+Get Resource 1+
      \verb+Release Resource 1+
      \verb+Release Resource 2+
    \end{columns}
  \vfill
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Processor 1 gets Resource 1, then Processor 2 gets Resource 2, now
          they both wait for each other \structure{(deadlock)}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
