\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Define A Race Condition}

A race occurs when you have two concurrent accesses to the
same memory location, at least one of which is a {\bf write}.

This definition is a little bit strict. 

We could also say that there is a race condition if there is some form of output, such as writing to the console. 

If one thread is going to write ``1'' to the console and another is going to write ``2'', then we could have a race condition. 

If there is no co-ordination, we could get output of ``12'' or ``21''. 

If the order here is unimportant, there's no issue; but if one order is correct, then the appearance of the other is a bug.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Matters of State}

When there's a race, the final state may not be the same as running
one access to completion and then the other. 

But it ``usually'' is.  It's nondeterministic. 

The fact that the output is often ``12'' and only very occasionally ``21'' may make it very difficult to track down the source of the problem.

\frametitle{Hazards}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{images/hazard.png}
\end{center}

In other situations (e.g., processor design) these are sometimes referred to as data hazards or dependencies. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{RAW} (Read After Write)	
	\item \textbf{WAR} (Write After Read)
	\item \textbf{WAW} (Write After Write)
	\item \textbf{RAR} (Read After Read) - No such hazard! 
\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{It's a Kind of Hazard}
Race conditions typically arise between variables shared
between threads.

\begin{minipage}[l]{0.39\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

void* run1(void* arg) {
    int* x = (int*) arg;
    *x += 1;
}

void* run2(void* arg) {
    int* x = (int*) arg;
    *x += 2;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[r]{0.6\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int* x = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *x = 1;
    pthread_t t1, t2;
    pthread_create(&t1, NULL, &run1, x);
    pthread_join(t1, NULL);
    pthread_create(&t2, NULL, &run2, x);
    pthread_join(t2, NULL);
    printf("%d\n", *x);
    free(x);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;

}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{It's a Kind of Hazard II}

{\scriptsize
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int* x = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *x = 1;
    pthread_t t1, t2;
    pthread_create(&t1, NULL, &run1, x);
    pthread_create(&t2, NULL, &run2, x);
    pthread_join(t1, NULL);
    pthread_join(t2, NULL);
    printf("%d\n", *x);
    free(x);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
\end{lstlisting}
}

Now do we have a race?

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Trace the Race}

What are the possible outputs? (Assume that initially {\tt *x} is 1.)
We'll look at compiler intermediate code (three-address code) to tell.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
run1                          run2   
D.1 = *x;                     D.1 = *x;
D.2 = D.1 + 1;                D.2 = D.1 + 2
*x = D.2;                     *x = D.2;
  \end{lstlisting}


Memory reads and writes are key in data~races.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Trace the Race}
Let's call the read and write from {\tt run1} R1 and W1; R2 and W2
from {\tt run2}.

Here are all possible orderings:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{llll|l}
\multicolumn{4}{c|}{Order} & {\tt *x}\\
\hline
R1 & W1 & R2 & W2 & 4 \\
R1 & R2 & W1 & W2 & 3 \\
R1 & R2 & W2 & W1 & 2 \\
R2 & W2 & R1 & W1 & 4 \\
R2 & R1 & W2 & W1 & 2 \\
R2 & R1 & W1 & W2 & 3 \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

\end{frame}

Can we execute these 2 lines in parallel? (initially x is 2)
\begin{lstlisting}
y = x + 1

\end{lstlisting}
\pause
\structure{Yes.}\\[1em]
\begin{itemize}
\item Variables y and z are independent.
\item Variable x is only read.
\end{itemize}

RAR dependency allows parallelization.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Synchronization}

You'll need some sort of synchronization to get sane results from
multithreaded programs. 

Hopefully you remember semaphores and mutexes from earlier courses.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Mutual Exclusion}

Mutexes are a very common of synchronization.
As a reminder:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Only one thread can access code protected by a mutex at a time.
    \item All other threads must wait until the mutex is free before they can
      execute the protected code.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/protect-house.jpg}
\end{center}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Using a Mutex}

  Here's an example of using mutexes:
    
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
      \begin{minipage}{.65\textwidth}
        {\bf pthreads}
{\scriptsize
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
pthread_mutex_t m1_static = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_mutex_t m2_dynamic;

pthread_mutex_init(&m2_dynamic, NULL);
...
pthread_mutex_destroy(&m1_static);
pthread_mutex_destroy(&m2_dynamic);
  \end{lstlisting}
  }
      \end{minipage}
      \begin{minipage}{.35\textwidth}

        {\bf C++11}
{\scriptsize
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
mutex m1;
mutex * m2;

m2 = new mutex();
// ...

delete (m2);
  \end{lstlisting}
  }
      \end{minipage}
    \end{tabular}

You can initialize mutexes statically (as with {\tt m1\_static}) or
dynamically ({\tt m2\_dynamic}). 

If you want to include attributes,
you need to use the dynamic version.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Mutex Attributes}

 Both threads and mutexes use the notion of attributes.
 

  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Protocol}: specifies the protocol used to prevent priority
      inversions for a mutex.
    \item {\bf Prioceiling}: specifies the priority ceiling of a mutex.
    \item {\bf Process-shared}: specifies the process sharing of a mutex.
  \end{itemize}
  
  You can specify a mutex as {\it process shared} so that you can access it
  between processes.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Try, Try Again}

There is also the idea of trylock: you attempt to lock the mutex in a way that you won't get blocked whether we acquire the lock or not. 

The function returns a value to indicate if we succeeded and it is mandatory that we check. 

If successful, proceed. 

If unsuccessful then we'll have to try again at some point.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Protect the End Zone}

Key idea: locks protect resources; only one thread
can hold a lock at a time. 

A second thread trying to obtain the lock
(i.e. \alert{contending} for the lock) has to wait, or \alert{block},
until the first thread releases the lock. 

So only one thread has
access to the protected resource at a time. 

The code between the lock
acquisition and release is known as the \alert{critical region} or \alert{critical section}.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Don't Lock Too Much}

Excessive use of locks can serialize programs. 

Consider two resources
$A$ and $B$ protected by a single lock $\ell$. 

Then a thread that's
just interested in $B$ still has acquire $\ell$, which requires it to
wait for any other thread working with $A$.

Example: Linux Big Kernel Lock

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Spinlocks}

Spinlocks are a variant of mutexes, where the
waiting thread repeatedly tries to acquire the lock instead of sleeping.

Use spinlocks when you expect critical sections to finish 
quickly.

Spinning
for a long time consumes lots of CPU resources.

 Many lock
implementations use both sleeping and spinlocks: spin for a bit,
then sleep longer.


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why Use Spinlocks?}

When would we ever want to use a spinlock?

What we normally expect is to block until the lock becomes available. 

But that means a process switch, and then a switch back in the future when the lock is available.  This takes nonzero time. 

It's optimal to use a spinlock if the amount of time we expect to wait for the lock is less than the amount of time it would take to do two process switches. 

As long as we have a multicore system.
