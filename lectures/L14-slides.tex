  \frametitle{Memory Model}

  

  OpenMP uses a {\bf relaxed-consistency, shared-memory} model:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item All threads share a single store called
      \structure{memory}.\\ ~~(may not actually represent RAM)\\[1em]
    \item Each thread can have its own {\it temporary} view of memory.\\[1em]
    \item A thread's {\it temporary} view of memory is not required to be
      consistent with memory.
  \end{itemize}~\\

  We'll talk more about memory models later.

 Does this code actually prevent simultaneous execution?

    Sorry! With OpenMP's memory model, no guarantees:\\
    the update from one thread may not be seen by the other.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Flush: Ensuring Consistent Views of Memory}

  \begin{center}
    {\tt \#pragma omp }{\bf flush} {\it[(list)]}
  \end{center}

  
    Makes the thread's temporary view of memory consistent with main
      memory; hence:\\[1em]
    $\bullet$ enforces an order on the memory operations of the variables.\\[1em]
    The variables in the list are called the {\it flush-set}. 
    If no variables given, the compiler will determine them for you.
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Explaining Flush}

  
  Enforcing an order on the memory operations means:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item All read/write operations on the {\it flush-set} which happen
      before the {\bf flush} complete before the flush executes.
    \item All read/write operations on the {\it flush-set} which happen
      after the {\bf flush} complete after the flush executes.
    \item Flushes with overlapping {\it flush-sets} can not be reordered.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Flush Correctness}

  
  To show a consistent value for a variable between two threads, 
  OpenMP must run statements in this order:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $t_1$ writes the value to $v$;
    \item $t_1$ flushes $v$; 
    \item $t_2$ flushes $v$ also;
    \item $t_2$ reads the consistent value from $v$.
  \end{enumerate}
  
\end{frame}

/* thread 1 */                      /* thread 2 */

atomic(b = 1)                       atomic(a = 1)
flush(b)                            flush(a)
flush(a)                            flush(b)
atomic(tmp = a)                     atomic(tmp = b)

  \frametitle{No Luck Yet: Why Flush Fails}

  

  \begin{center}
    \alert{\LARGE No.}
  \end{center}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The compiler can reorder the {\tt flush(b)} in thread 1 or
      {\tt flush(a)} in thread 2.

    \item If {\tt flush(b)} gets reordered to after the protected
      section, we will not get our intended operation.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf nowait} removes implicit flush along with the implicit barrier

  This is not true for OpenMP versions before 2.5, so be careful.

     Generates a task for a thread in the team to run.\\[1em]
     When a thread enters the region it may:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item immediately execute the task; or
        \item defer its execution.\\\qquad  (any other thread may be assigned the task)

    the generating task region is suspended until execution of the

  \begin{center}
  {\bf final} {\it(scalar-logical-expression)}
  \end{center}

    When expression is {\tt true}, generates a final task.\\
    All tasks within a final task are {\it included}.\\
    Included tasks are undeferred and also execute immediately in the same thread.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{{\tt untied} and {\tt mergeable} Clauses}

  
\begin{center}
  {\bf untied}
\end{center}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A suspended task can be resumed by any thread.
    \item ``untied'' is ignored if used with {\bf final}.
    \item Interacts poorly with thread-private variables and {\tt gettid()}.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{center}
  {\bf mergeable}
\end{center}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item For an undeferred or included task,
    allows the implementation to generate a merged task instead.
    \item In a merged task, the implementation may re-use the environment from its generating task (as if there was no task directive).
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Bad {\tt mergeable} Example}

  
  \begin{lstlisting}
#include <stdio.h>
void foo () {
    int x = 2;
    #pragma omp task mergeable
    {
        x++; // x is by default firstprivate
    }
    #pragma omp taskwait
    printf("%d\n",x); // prints 2 or 3
}
  \end{lstlisting}
  
    This is an incorrect usage of {\bf mergeable}: the output depends
      on whether or not the task got merged.\\[1em]
    Merging tasks (when safe) produces more efficient code.

    \item Unnecessary concurrent-memory-writing protection:
      \begin{itemize}

        \item No need to protect if only accessed in {\bf single} or
