  Want it to run faster? Avoid these pitfalls:\\
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Unnecessary flush directives.
    \item Using critical sections or locks instead of atomic.
    \item Unnecessary concurrent-memory-writing protection:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item No need to protect local thread variables.
        \item No need to protect if only accessed in {\bf single} or
          {\bf master}.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Too much work in a critical section.
    \item Too many entries into critical sections.
  \end{enumerate}
  \end{changemargin}

  \frametitle{Example: Reducing Too Many Entries into Critical Sections}

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}
  \large
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C,morekeywords={foreach,pragma,omp,parallel,single,nowait,task,untied,barrier,taskyield,mergeable,final,taskwait,critical}]
#pragma omp parallel for
for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) { 
    #pragma omp critical
    {
        if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
    } 
}
  \end{lstlisting}

would be better as:

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C,morekeywords={foreach,pragma,omp,parallel,single,nowait,task,untied,barrier,taskyield,mergeable,final,taskwait,critical}]
#pragma omp parallel for
for (i = 0 ; i < N; ++i) { 
    #pragma omp flush(max)
    if (arr[i] > max) {
          #pragma omp critical
          {
                if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
          }
    }
}
