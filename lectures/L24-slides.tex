Think back: what operations are fast and what operations are not?

Takeaway: our intuition  is often wrong. 

Not just at a macro level, \\
but at a micro level. 

You may be able to narrow down that this computation of $x$ is slow, \\
but if you examine it carefully\ldots what parts of it are slow?

\begin{quote}
\textit{Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97\% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3\%.}

\frametitle{That Saying You Were Expecting}

\Large
\begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
Feeling lucky? \\
Maybe you optimized a slow part. 

To make your programs or systems fast, \\
you need to find out what is currently slow and improve it (duh!). 

Up until now, it's mostly been about \\
\qquad ``let's speed this up''.\\
We haven't taken much time to decide what we should speed up.
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Basic Overview}

\Large
\begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
General idea:\\
\qquad collect data on what parts of the code\\
\qquad are taking up most of the time.

\begin{itemize}
\item What functions get called?
\item How long do functions take?
\item What's using memory?
\end{itemize}
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{\texttt{printf}}

\Large
\begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
There is always the ``informal'' way:\\

\qquad ``debug'' by print statements.

On entry to \texttt{foo}, \\
log ``entering function foo'', plus timestamp.

On exit, \\
log ``exiting foo'', also with timestamp.
\end{changemargin}


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Console Profiling}

\Large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
Kind of works, and [JZ] has used it to figure out what blocks of a single large function are taking a long time (updating exchange rates\ldots yeah). 

But this approach is not necessarily good.  

This is ``invasive'' profiling---change the source code of the program to add instrumentation (log statements). 

Plus we have to do a lot of manual accounting.

Doesn't really scale.
\end{changemargin}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Wizardry!}

\Large
\begin{changemargin}{2cm}
Like debugging:\\
\qquad if you get to be a wizard you can maybe do it by code inspection.

But speculative execution inside your head is harder for perf than debugging.

So: we want to use tools \\ 
and do this in a methodical way.

    Two main outputs:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item flat;
        \item call-graph.

    Two main data gathering methods:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Only computes average time in a particular function.
    \item Does not include other (useful) information (callees).
  \end{itemize}

~\\[1em]

  {\bf Call-graph Profiler:}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Computes call times.
    \item Reports frequency of function calls.
    \item Gives a call graph: who called what function?

  {\bf Statistical:}

  Mostly, take samples of the system state, that is:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item every 100ms, check the system state.
    \item will cause some slowdown, but not much.
  \end{itemize}
~\\[1em]

  {\bf Instrumentation:}\\
  Add instructions at specified program points:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item can do this at compile time or run time (expensive);
    \item can instrument either manually or automatically;
    \item like conditional breakpoints.

  When writing large software projects:\\[1em]

     $\bullet$ First, write clear and concise code. \\
      \qquad Don't do premature optimizations---\\
      \qquad focus on correctness.\\
     $\bullet$ Profile to get a baseline of your performance:\\[0em]
      \begin{itemize}
        \item allows you to easily track any performance changes;
        \item allows you to re-design your program before it's too late.

    Like {\tt gprof}, it will analyze profiling results.

  \begin{lstlisting}
% pprof test test.prof
    Enters "interactive" mode
% pprof --text test test.prof
    Outputs one line per procedure
% pprof --gv test test.prof
     Displays annotated call-graph via 'gv'
% pprof --gv --focus=Mutex test test.prof
    Restricts to code paths including a .*Mutex.* entry
% pprof --gv --focus=Mutex --ignore=string test test.prof
    Code paths including Mutex but not string
% pprof --list=getdir test test.prof
    (Per-line) annotated source listing for getdir()
% pprof --disasm=getdir test test.prof
    (Per-PC) annotated disassembly for getdir()
  \end{lstlisting}

    Can also output {\tt dot}, {\tt ps}, {\tt pdf} or {\tt gif} instead of
      {\tt gv}.

  Output was too small to read on the slide.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Shows the same numbers as the text output.
    \item Directed edges denote function calls.
    \item Note: number of samples in callees = \\
      \qquad number in ``this function + callees'' - \\
      \qquad number in ``this function''.\\
    \item {\bf Example:}\\
{{\tt float\_math\_helper}, 51 (local) of 96 (cumulative)} \\
      96 - 51 = 45 (callees)
      \begin{itemize}

    Call graph is not exact.
    
      \begin{itemize}
        \item In fact, it shows many bogus relations which clearly don't exist.
        \item For instance, we know that there are no cross-calls between {\tt int} and {\tt float} functions.
      \end{itemize}~\\

    As with {\tt gprof}, optimizations will change the
      graph.\\[1em]

    You'll probably want to look at the text profile first, then use the
      {\tt --focus} flag to look at individual functions.
