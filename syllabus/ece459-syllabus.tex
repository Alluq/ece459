\section*{About the Course}

\paragraph{Undergraduate Calendar Description} ``Profiling computer systems; bottlenecks, Amdahl's law. Concurrency: threads and locks. Techniques for programming multicore processors; cache consistency. Transactional memory. Streaming architectures, vectorization, and SIMD. High-performance programming languages.''

\paragraph{Prerequisites} ECE~252, ECE~254, or SE~350 (or equivalent); Level at least 4A Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering or Software Engineering.

Or, to put that in less formal terms: remember when we talked about semaphores and mutexes and all of that? If not, well, \url{https://github.com/jzarnett/ece254/tree/master/lectures}. (Or you can look at the ECE 252 notes, or CS 343). Also, I really hope you feel comfortable with programming. This isn't the place for you if you're not feeling confident in programming. Really. Does \texttt{void*} scare you? If it does, flee while you still can!

\section*{Brief Overview}

Many modern software systems must process large amounts of data, either in the
form of huge data sets or vast numbers of (concurrent) transactions.  This
course introduces students to techniques for profiling, rearchitecting, and
implementing software systems that can handle industrial-sized
inputs. These techniques will enable you to design and build
critical software infrastructure, especially in an age of Big Data.

While you may have seen some of these ideas in the context of
operating systems (ECE254/SE350/CS350) and concurrency (ECE252/CS343), this course gives you tools to make code run
faster. The focus in OS/concurrency is understanding and implementing the
primitives; our focus is on using them effectively. 

We will sometimes see implementation details that you need to get right to write
certain applications, but as with any university-level course, this course
focusses more on the concepts than magic invocations, so that you can continue
to apply the basic ideas after the technologies inevitably change.


\section*{General Information}

\paragraph{Course Website} The lecture material will be at \url{https://github.com/jzarnett/ece459}. The primary source for course materials is github. We'll also use Piazza. See the section about the piazza policy.

  Lectures 001 & MF & 8:30 -- 9:50 & DC-1351\\ 
  Tutorials &  &  Exist in the schedule, but we won't use them& \\
  Labs &  &  No scheduled lab meeting room or time & \\
  \end{tabular}
  
Midterm exam date, time, and location to be announced by the ECE department \footnote{\url{https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/current-undergraduate-students/academic-planning-and-support/mid-term-examinations/}}. It will be 60 minutes in length.
  
Final exam to be announced on or after 31 January; it will be scheduled by the RO as per usual.

\textit{Schedule Oddities:} Reading week is 17-21 February. In principle, 3rd and 4th year classes don't happen on the day of Capstone Project Symposia. There are a lot of programs represented in our course, to the point where no single program accounts for more than half of the students. Therefore we are not cancelling classes. We understand if you are going to miss it. We're also aware that IRS is a thing (8 February 2020).

\textit{Final Exam}: The final exam dates are 8 April - 25 April. It could fall at any time in this period. Note that student travel plans are \emph{not} considered an acceptable reason for missing an exam. When it is announced, please alert your instructor immediately if you have a conflict.

\paragraph{About Prof. Zarnett.}
I graduated from the Computer Engineering program at Waterloo (under a previous curriculum), and have since earned my Master's Degree (also at Waterloo) and my P.Eng. license. For the last 6+ years I have also been teaching here at UW and the other courses I have taught and worked on include ECE~150, ECE~155, ECE~252, ECE~254, ECE~290, ECE~356, and MTE~241.

In addition to being your instructor, I work full time in software engineering in industry. It's my job to help you learn, so contact me if you feel the need. The vast majority of the week, I will not be on campus, so stopping by my office is a very inefficient way to find me. The best way to get questions answered is via Piazza. If you would like, however, send me an e-mail and we can make arrangements for office hours. 

\paragraph{About the Teaching Assistants.}

Teaching assistants can help you with the course material, including assignments and exams. They will do most of the lab marking.


\noindent {\bf Teaching Assistants:}

\item Michael Giannikouris {\tt mgiannik@uwaterloo.ca }
\item Stephen Li {\tt stephen.li@uwaterloo.ca }

\end{itemize}


\section*{Texbook}
There's no required textbook for the course. The notes cite a number of sources, some of which are useful books.

\section*{Evaluation}
This course includes assignments, a midterm, and a final
examination. Too many fourth-year courses have projects. This tends to make the end of term insane. We won't contribute to that problem too much.\vspace*{1em}

\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace*{5em}}l}
Assignments & 60\% (4 at 15\% each) \\
Midterm & 10\% \\
Final exam & 30\% \\
\end{tabular}

A grade of INC (Incomplete) is to be assigned if you do not attempt all assignments.  If the assignments are not completed within 4 months of the end of the course to the satisfaction of the course instructor, the INC (Incomplete) grade will be converted to FTC  (Failure to Complete).  If the assignments are completed successfully  within  the  required  timeframe,  the  overall  grade  will  be  calculated using the  rules  for  late assignment submission. Furthermore, any submitted assignment must be an honest attempt---submitting an empty project or similar is not adequate. 

\paragraph{Exams.} Exams will be open-book, open-notes, calculators without communication capability, no communication devices. The University rules say if you miss the final exam, without an acceptable reason, your grade in the class will be DNW---Did Not Write. This is very undesirable. Show up for the final exam.

\paragraph{Tutorials.} This class has tutorials scheduled. 4th year students basically never attend tutorials so there's no point in using them, right?


\paragraph{Assignments.} Since this course has ``programming'' in the 
title, you will be expected to write code for these assignments.  Here
is a projected list of assignments for this course. We plan to have 4
assignments as below, although they are subject to change:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Manual parallelization for servers with pthreads and asynchronous I/O;
\item Using compiler-provided automatic parallelization and OpenMP;
\item GPU programming with OpenCL;
\item Profiling or load balancing.
\end{enumerate}
Assignment hand-in will be done via \texttt{git} using the university provided git.uwaterloo.ca service.

Your assignment code will be checked for plagiarism using MOSS (Measure Of Software Similarity) as well as some manual checks. You may request to opt out of the automatic screening by sending a formal written letter to your instructor explaining why; a meeting will then follow to discuss the subject with the instructor.

You'll have at least two weeks to do each assignment. Trying to place the assignment due dates in the term is hard; We try to avoid FYDP deadlines, not place them on top of midterms, keep them vaguely in sync with the course material covered so far, and finally we're not allowed to make the due date for them during reading week or after the end of term. Oh, and because there are so many students from so many programs, it is effectively impossible to pick a date that works for everyone. Apologies in advance. That's why there are grace days (see below).


\paragraph{Lateness.} Also known as ``Grace Days''. You have 4 days of lateness to use on 
submissions throughout the term. Each day you hand in something late
consumes one of the days of lateness. The fifth day of lateness causes
your lowest assignment mark to be halved, while the sixth day causes
both assignment marks to be halved. If you hand in something and you
have more than 6 days of lateness, I'll start converting marks to 0
and dropping the associated late days. You don't
get any credit for unused late days.

For example, you may hand in A1 one day late, A2 two days late, A3 1
one day late, and everything else on time.  Or you can hand A2 four
days late, if you hand in everything else on time. Finally, if you
hand in A1 3 days late, A2 1 day late, A3 3 days late, and
everything else on time, We will either give you a 0 for A1, leaving you
with 4 late days, or give you a 0 for A2, leaving you with 5 late days
and causing your mark for A1 to be halved. We'll choose the option
which gives you more marks.

Grace days are tracked in Learn for transparency.

\paragraph{Group work.} 
You may discuss assignments with others, but we expect each of you to
do each assignment independently. Acceptable collaboration includes
discussing ideas and structures with others, as well as helping others
debug their code. If your code is too close in structure to someone
else's code, you are going to have a problem. The best way to avoid
such problems is by (1) not sending your code around; and (2) not
writing down anything beyond general notes (pseudocode) about other
peoples' code. We will follow UW's Policy 71 if I discover any cases of
plagiarism (and we have). 

We want to emphasize that we take the issue of plagiarism very seriously, and so does the University of Waterloo. If you are uncertain about this subject, please seek some guidance. There are many resources available to you. You can check the university policies, talk to the course instructor, ECE/SE undergrad office, et cetera.

Or, let's sum this up in two short instructions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Acknowledge the work of others. 
	\item If you are uncertain, ask!
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Piazza Policy.}
Piazza is a great tool for collaboration and it allows rapid but asynchronous exchange of information. It almost goes without saying, but we ask you to be respectful and polite when communicating via this medium and to assume the best about others, as tone can be difficult to interpret on a discussion forum. 

Before posting your question, please consider whether this question can be answered by looking at either the course notes, lab manual, or documentation available on the internet (e.g., man pages). To help others find answers later, (1) screenshot-only posts are discouraged (since the content does not show up in search results) and (2) please restrict a single thread to one question (or a closely-related set of questions).

For the most part, we encourage (but do not require) you to make your question(s) public so that other students may benefit from the answer. If something was non-obvious or unclear to you, it was likely to others as well. If your question includes detailed design information or code excerpts related to a deliverable (e.g., an assignment), then making it a private question is necessary.

Please also keep in mind that course staff may not be able to answer your question immediately as they have many other responsibilities throughout the term (and that the frequency of questions tends to spike before due dates or exams). We encourage you to think through the problem before posting, but acknowledge that just like ``rubber duck debugging'' sometimes the act of writing down the nature of the problem provides insight into solving it.

\paragraph{Re-marking.}
If you believe that your grade on the midterm is incorrect, you may ask that it be re-marked. To request that a question be re-marked, you will need to submit your request in writing via e-mail to the instructor.

When you submit your request, it should include the following: (1) Your name and student ID number; (2) a clear indication of which question or part of the deliverable is to be re-marked; and (3) an explanation of why you believe the grade assigned was incorrect.

Requests for re-marking may be submitted any time before the final exam. Be forewarned, when a deliverable is being re-marked, your grade could go up, it could stay the same, or it could go down. You will be notified of the outcome.

\paragraph{Extra Credit}
In this class, there will be no opportunities to earn extra credit. Make-up assignments or examinations will not be offered under any circumstances.

\paragraph{Attendance \& Illness}

Personal opinion on attending classes: it is usually a good idea to attend lectures. That said, attendance is not taken and not graded.

Some advice Professor Gebotys gave long ago: If you are tired, go sleep at home. Sleeping in the lecture doesn't work; you will get poor quality of sleep and you won't learn the material while you're asleep, either.

If you feel ill, you should seek appropriate medical attention. If you miss an exam for health reasons, you need a verification of illness form (and it has to be rated ``severe'' on the form). Forms can be completed by the physicians at Health Services or other healthcare providers in the area. If you anticipate missing a deliverable deadline or an examination for a non-medical reason, you should contact your instructor as soon as you are aware of the problem. Given sufficient notice, alternate arrangements may be possible. Alternate arrangements are rare and at instructor discretion.

\paragraph{Laptop and Device Policy}
The human visual system has evolved to perceive saber-toothed tigers
in the savannah. Fortunately, tigers are rare in Waterloo, Ontario
(Geese, on the other hand...).
Unfortunately, your classmates are still human and hence their
attention will be drawn to flashing lights (or Facebook, or movies, or
video games) in their peripheral vision. We encourage
everyone to be respectful of their classmates and to not distract them.

Wise use of computers and the Internet can be helpful for fully
engaging in class. You might want to try out some syntax, or you might
want to look up constructors, or you might want to verify your
instructor's somewhat outrageous-sounding claim.

To support the benefits of the Internet while reducing distractions,
we will adopt the following policy in this class. We are asking that the
first 2 rows of class be text-oriented: if using a device, use a
command prompt or text editor, maximized to the whole screen. Paper is
always good, of course. Mac OS X and UNIX command prompts are probably
your best bet; for those of you on Windows, you can use the Windows
Subsystem for Linux. From the command prompt, you can use compilers
and text-mode web browsers (w3m, lynx, links/elinks, etc....) tmux may
also be helpful in managing multiple terminal sessions. Being
proficient with the terminal is a highly-useful skill for a Software
Engineer.

We acknowledge that lectures are not always engaging. Instead of
distracting screen content, we recommend non-distracting ways of tuning
out, like doodling on paper (while taking notes), or doing homework.
(we also recommend passing notes to each other instead of talking).

If you need to sit towards the front of the class and use a GUI
program, then please discuss with your instructor to register
yourself as an exception. If you sign up for
the exception list, we'll ask to you agree to not display games,
videos, or social media on your screen (unless it is part of the
class).

Enforcement is a sensitive issue, especially given the existence of
exceptions. We are primarily asking each of you to respect the policy
on your own. But, if you see someone with games, videos, or social
media in the terminal zone, you can politely bring it up with them.

tl;dr: paper or text-oriented programs in first 2 rows of class.
